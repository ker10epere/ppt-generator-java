Hero

There's a hero
If you look inside your heart

You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are

There's an answer
If you reach into your soul

And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
---
Fearless

There's somethin' bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained

There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car

And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot

Yeah
Oh, yeah
